2. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.
An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.
My algorithm is done in C++ and displayed in IsAnagram.cpp.
Description and Logic: 
    Well, my first thought was, oh I could just compare the sizes! Well, you can have two similarly sized words that aren't anagrams, so that doesn't work.
    Then I remembered, well hey! In the C++ STL, there's a sort function that can let me sort two words and compare them. So I created copies of each word,
    and I sorted them from beginning to end. I then compared the two copies: if both strings were equal, returned true, otherwise returned false.
Time complexity: O(n log n)
Space complexity: O(n)
